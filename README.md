## Overview

Rusic allows you to scan your local directories for audio files, or you jellyfin library, automatically organizing them into a browsable library. You can navigate by artists, albums, or explore your custom playlists. The application is built for performance and desktop integration, utilizing the power of Rust.

## Features

- **Theming**: Includes dynamic theming support to customize the visual appearance.
- **Native Integration**: Integrates with system media controls (MPRIS) and "Now Playing" displays.
- **Discord RPC**: Embedded RPC included!!!
- **Double Option**: Yes, you can also use your jellyfin server to listen to your music coming from your server!
- **Lyrics Support**: Enjoy real-time synced and plain lyrics, complete with auto-scrolling to follow along with your music.
- **High Performance**: Heavy background processing and an optimized library scanner ensure the app opens instantly, runs smoothly, and skips previously indexed files quickly.
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Automatically removes missing or deleted tracks from your library when rescanning.
- **Smooth Navigation**: Enjoy a polished interface where scroll positions reset properly as you browse different views and pages.

## Installation

### NixOS / Nix

**Run directly without installing:**

```bash
nix run github:temidaradev/rusic
```

**Install to your profile:**

```bash
nix profile add github:temidaradev/rusic
```

**NixOS flake (recommended — installs as a proper system app with icon & `.desktop` entry):**

Add rusic to your `flake.nix` inputs:

```nix
inputs.rusic.url = "github:temidaradev/rusic";
```

Pass it through to your system config and add the Cachix substituter so it downloads the pre-built binary instead of compiling:

```nix
# nixos/nix/default.nix
nix.settings = {
  substituters      = [ "https://cache.nixos.org" "https://rusic.cachix.org" ];
  trusted-public-keys = [
    "cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY="
    "rusic.cachix.org-1:WXMpGpamblLUiJtcoxBxGGGGwIcWxGPJBUxarLiqWmw="
  ];
};
```

Then install the package:

```nix
# configuration.nix || machine.nix
environment.systemPackages = [
  rusic.packages.${system}.default
];
```


### Flatpak (Recommended)

Rusic is soon available on Flathub. To install from source manifest:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temidaradev/rusic
cd rusic
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir com.temidaradev.rusic.json
flatpak run com.temidaradev.rusic
```

You can also click on the file and open it with an app provider, for example KDE discover

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temidaradev/rusic
cd rusic
npm install
dx serve --package rusic
```

### macOS

**Quarantine note:** If you downloaded a `.dmg` instead, macOS may block it. Run once to clear the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Rusic.app
```


### Where does Rusic keep its files?

On **macOS** everything lives under your Library folders:
- `~/Library/Application Support/com.temidaradev.rusic/config.json` — your settings
- `~/Library/Caches/com.temidaradev.rusic/library.json` — the scanned library
- `~/Library/Caches/com.temidaradev.rusic/playlists.json` — your playlists
- `~/Library/Caches/com.temidaradev.rusic/covers/` — cached album art

On **Linux** it follows the XDG spec like you'd expect:
- `~/.config/rusic/config.json` — your settings
- `~/.cache/rusic/library.json` — the scanned library
- `~/.cache/rusic/playlists.json` — your playlists
- `~/.cache/rusic/covers/` — cached album art

If covers aren't showing or the library looks off, just delete the cache folder and hit rescan.

### Scrobbling functionality

Scrobbling functionality is only available through MusicBrainz (for now). To enable it, you need to provide a valid MusicBrainz token in the configuration file. The scrobbling also is only available for your local musics. It's highly recommended to use [jellyfin-plugin-listenbrainz](https://github.com/lyarenei/jellyfin-plugin-listenbrainz), because if you also use other music apps for your jellyfin server, you can scrobble your music from anywhere.
